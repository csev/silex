# My Experiments With Silex

These are bits of sample code to test feasibility of doing what I want to do 
with the Silex Framework.  Sof far these were my challenges:

* How to evolve from using `$_SESSION` to `$app['session']`
* How to load Twig templates from a class in the autoloader
* Check if Silex routes are relative at each level of the hierarchy

# Install

Check this out from github and then do 

    composer update

# Playground

You can play with this code
